<h1> About me:
Hello! My name is Muhammad Alamgeer, and I am a Graduate Research Assistant in the Department of Agronomy at the University of Florida. My work centers on crop nutrient management, soil health, and climate-resilient cropping systems, particularly in industrial hemp and other emerging crops across diverse agroecosystems. I have experience in field experimentation, data analysis using R, and developing recommendations to improve crop productivity and environmental sustainability. </h1>
